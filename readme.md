**This repository contains source code for the https://maui.graphics website.** [Microsoft.Maui.Graphics](https://github.com/dotnet/Microsoft.Maui.Graphics) is a 2D graphics library developed by Microsoft as part of the [.NET MAUI project](https://github.com/dotnet/maui). It can be used to create 2D graphics in most .NET projects (not just MAUI apps).

**Purpose of this website:** Developers searching for documentation may type `Microsoft.Maui.Graphics` in the address bar intending to perform a web search. Since `.graphics` is a top level domain, this action results in a HTTP request which eventually times-out and displays an error message. The domain name [maui.graphics](https://maui.graphics) was registered so these users will instead be presented with relevant links.
